# Maze

Maze is a website that visualizes graph pathfinding algorithms.

## Todo

- [x] Canvas grid that can take in walls, start point, and end point.
  - [x] Create canvas representation
  - [x] Make each node clickable
  - [x] Insert new start/end points
  - [x] Insert walls 
  - [x] Insertion alters data within the grid data structure
  - [x] Buttons created for different states of adding to the grid (start/end/walls)
- [ ] Path finding algorithm implementation with BFS/DFS.
- [ ] Refactor code
- [ ] Maze creation with BFS/Recursive division algorithms.
- [ ] Advanced animation with block being added to grid(from walls, graph traversals, etc.)
- [ ] More advanced path find algos (Djikstra's, A*, Best-First)
